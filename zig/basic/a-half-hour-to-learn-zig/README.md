# README

The code snippets came from [A half-hour to learn Zig](https://gist.github.com/ityonemo/769532c2017ed9143f3571e5ac104e50).

When I try the code with Zig0.12, I had some adaptations to make (often changing `var` declaration into `const` declaration).
However sometimes I was not able to correct directly the code to make it compiles or works correctly.
The following code snippets does not work :

* 20-basic-error-handling
* 21-error-management-with-if
* 29-heap-and-allocator

As a matter of fact, when I try these snippets and wrote this README file, I was at the very beginning of my Zig journey.
So, I will try to correct the snippets later when I knowlegde of Zig will be better.
